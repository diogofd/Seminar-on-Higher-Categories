# Seminar-on-Higher-Categories

Backend for a website page supporting the graduate-level course "Seminar on Higher-Categories" taught by me and John Huerta on the Spring semester of 2022/2023 at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

The site will be hosted using GitHub Pages + Jekyll.

The theme is Minima.
