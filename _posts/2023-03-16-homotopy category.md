## The homotopy catgory of an $$\infty$$-category

In class, we defined a left and right notion of homotopy relation for 1-morphisms in an $$\infty$$-category $$\mathcal C$$. We left as an exercise for you guys to check that, given a pair $$f,g\colon x \rightarrow y $$ of 1-morphisms, we have that

$$ f\sim_{l}g \,\, \Leftrightarrow  \,\,  f\sim_{r} g$$

the left and right relations agree. Moreover, they form an equivalence relation on $$\mathsf{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(x,y).$$
