Hey everyone, this is the official page for the seminar on $$\infty$$-categories ran by [John Huerta](https://math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~jhuerta/) and Diogo Freire de Andrade in the Spring Semester of the 2022/2023 academic year.

## Prerequisites
The seminar is designed for everyone who has been lightly exposed to **Category Theory** and **Algebraic Topology**, but we do not assume more than superficial knowledge of homotopies, functors, limits and colimits - we have designed it to be as self-contained as possible.

## Seminar Structure:
The seminar will be ran **weekly**, in a 2-hour-lecture format, on **Wednesdays, from 14:30h to 16:30h in QA1.4**, the South Tower (Chemistry building).

### Outline:
The planned structure for the lectures will be as follows:

- ~~**Week 1**~~: Introduction to the topic of (weak) $$n$$-caetgories and $$(\infty,n)$$-categories.
  - [Notes](lectures/notes/Lecture1.pdf) by Rui Peixoto.
- ~~**Week 2**~~: Introduction to simplicial sets and a full characterization of nerves of categories.
  - [Notes](lectures/notes/Lecture2.pdf) by Rui Peixoto.
- ~~**Week 3**~~: Weak Kan complexes as $$\infty$$-categories, and suitable generalizations, the homotopy category of an $$\infty$$-category and the simplicial mapping space.
  - [Notes](lectures/notes/Lecture3.pdf) by Rui Peixoto.
- **Week 4**: Fibrations, skeletal filtrations, construction of the functor $$\infty$$-category.
- **Week 5**: Introduce joins, slices and the slice-join adjunction. Construct limits and colimits.
- **Week 6**: Introduction to coCartesian and Cartesian fibrations.
- **Week 7**: Grothendieck-Lurie's _Straighenting-Unstraightening_ lemma and introduction to Kan extensions.
- **Week 8**: Symmetric monoidal $$\infty$$-categories (part 1).
- **Week 9**: Symmetric monoidal $$\infty$$-categories (part 2) and an introduction to $$\infty$$-operads.

More detailed information on the lectures i.e. the summary, can be found in  the page [Lectures](diogofd.github.io/Seminar-on-Higher-Categories/lectures/).
The remaining lectures are expected to be given by the participants. The topics can be chosen from the list of [Topics]().
