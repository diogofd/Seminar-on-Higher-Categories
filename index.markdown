This is the official page for the seminar on $$\infty$$-categories run by [John
Huerta](https://math.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~jhuerta/) and Diogo Freire de Andrade in the
Spring Semester of the 2022/2023 academic year. Rui Peixoto took most of the notes.

## Prerequisites
The seminar is designed for everyone who has been lightly exposed to
**Category Theory** and **Algebraic Topology**, but we do not assume more than
superficial knowledge of homotopies, functors, limits and colimits - we have designed
it to be as self-contained as possible.

## Seminar Structure:
The seminar will take place **weekly**, in a two-hour lecture format, on
**Wednesdays, from 14:30 to 16:30 in P5.18** (mathematics building).

### Outline:
The planned structure for the lectures will be as follows:

- ~~**Week 1**~~: Introduction to the topic of (weak) $$n$$-caetgories and $$(\infty,n)$$-categories.
  - [Notes](lectures/notes/Lecture1.pdf) by Rui Peixoto.
- ~~**Week 2**~~: Introduction to simplicial sets and a full characterization of nerves of categories.
  - [Notes](lectures/notes/Lecture2.pdf) by Rui Peixoto.
- ~~**Week 3**~~: Weak Kan complexes as $$\infty$$-categories, and suitable generalizations, the homotopy category of an $$\infty$$-category and the simplicial mapping space.
  - [Notes](lectures/notes/Lecture3.pdf) by Rui Peixoto.
- ~~**Week 4**~~: Introduction to fibrations, and the construction of the functor $$\infty$$-category.
  - [Notes (Part 1)](lectures/notes/Lecture4pt1.pdf) and [(part 2)](/lectures/notes/Lecture4pt2.pdf) by Diogo Andrade
- ~~**Week 5**~~: Proof that the function complex is an $$\infty$$-category.
  - [Slides](lectures/notes/Lecture5.pdf) by Diogo Andrade.
- ~~**Week 6**~~: Introduction to Joins, Slices, the Join/Slice adjunction and limits and colimits.
  - [Slides](lectures/notes/Lecture6.pdf) by Diogo Andrade.
- ~~**Week 7**~~: More on the join/slice adjunction; the definition of initial and terminal objects.
  - [Slides](lectures/notes/Lecture7.pdf) by Diogo Andrade.

*In the following weeks, seminar participants will present [topics](topics/) of their choice:*
- ~~**Week 8**~~ - 10 May 2023: James Macpherson on weighted joins.

  - [Notes](lectures/notes/Topic-Nino.pdf) by Rui Peixoto.
- ~~**Week 12**~~ - 28 June 2023: Björn Gohla on Segal n-categories, a model for (∞,n)-categories.
