The case for higher categories as a foundational language for modern mathematics has been slowly building over the last 40 years. From the dreams of Grothendieck to Lurie's sketch of proof of the **Cobordism Hypothesis**

1. Homotopy (co)limits in model categories become objects with universal properties in $$\infty$$-categories.
2. Goodwillie tower of a functor, the Goerss--Hopkins--Miller obstruction tower

Replacing sets with grupoids, anyone?

- We regard sets as being "the same" whenever there is a bijection $$f\colon X \rightarrow X'$$ between them.
