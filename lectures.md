### Lecture 3
- **Date**: 15/03/2023
- **Lecturer**: Diogo Andrade
- **Summary**: 
    
    **Part 1**
    - We defined the notion of $$\infty$$-category as a weak Kan complex. We checked that there are sound notions of product, coproduct of $$\infty$$-categories and $$\infty$$-subcategories (full and non-full). 
    - We gave a definition of $$\infty$$-functor and $$\infty$$-natural transformation and checked that they agree with our ususal notions when seen from the nerve lens. 
    
    **Part 2** 
    - In the second half of the lecture we defined the fundamental category of a simplicial set via a universal property and we formally constructed it. 
    - We constructed the homotopy relation among 1-morphisms of an $$\infty$$-category and stated they form an equivalence relation on the sets of morphisms and that its natural projection functor satisfies the universal property for the fundamental category. 
    - In the end, we proved the mapping-product adjunction for simplicial sets, and in the proccess we defined mapping space/function complex $$\mathsf{Fun}(\mathcal C, \mathcal D)_\bullet$$ - this provided us with a sensible candiade for $$\infty$$-functor category.
