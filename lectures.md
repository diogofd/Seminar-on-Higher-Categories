### Lecture 1

- **Date**: 01/03/2023
- **Lecturer**: John Huerta
- **Summary**: 
    - An introduction to weak $$n$$-categories, models, and the homotopy hypothesis.
    - [Notes](notes/Lecture1.pdf) by Rui Peixoto.


### Lecture 2

- **Date**: 08/03/2023
- **Lecturer**: Diogo Andrade
- **Summary**: 
  - We did a less-than-superficial introduction to simplicial sets and introduced some helpful notation. 
  - We carefully introduced the nerve of a category as a simplicial set which satisfies a unique extension condition.
  - We showed that the nerve is a fully faithful functor.
  - We showed that nerves of categories are universally characterized by the unique extension condition.

### Lecture 3
- **Date**: 15/03/2023
- **Lecturer**: Diogo Andrade
- **Summary**: 
    
    **Part 1**
    - We defined the notion of $$\infty$$-category as a weak Kan complex. We checked that there are sound notions of product, coproduct of $$\infty$$-categories and $$\infty$$-subcategories (full and non-full). 
    - We gave a definition of $$\infty$$-functor and $$\infty$$-natural transformation and checked that they agree with our ususal notions when seen from the nerve lens. 
    
    **Part 2** 
    - In the second half of the lecture we defined the fundamental category of a simplicial set via a universal property and we formally constructed it. 
    - We constructed the homotopy relation among 1-morphisms of an $$\infty$$-category and stated they form an equivalence relation on the sets of morphisms and that its natural projection functor satisfies the universal property for the fundamental category. 
    - In the end, we proved the mapping-product adjunction for simplicial sets, and in the proccess we defined mapping space/function complex $$\mathsf{Fun}(\mathcal C, \mathcal D)_\bullet$$ - this provided us with a sensible candiade for $$\infty$$-functor category.

### Lecture 4
- **Date**: 22/03/2023
- **Lecturer**: Diogo Andrade
- **Summary**: 

    **Part 1**:
    - We introduced the notion of weakly saturated class and inner-anodyne map.
    - We introdueced and showed some results concerning lifting claculus and inner fibrations.
    
    **Part 2**:
    - We looked informally at some structural properties of the class of inner fibrations.
    - We skimmed over the small object arguement, the proof that the weak saturation of the class of boundary inclusions is the class of monomorphisms.
    - Constructed the pushout-product and pullback-hom and sketched a proof of the lifting adjunction theorem.

### Lectrue 5
- **Date**: 29/03/2023
- **Lectruer**: Diogo Andrade
- **Summary**: 

  - We proved that the function complex is an $$\infty$$-category by showing a trifecta of technical lemmas which can be summarized as: the  pushout-product of an inner-anodyne map and a monomrphism is again inner-anodyne.
  - We showed some variants of the above for other classes of morphisms. In particular we gave four different generating classes of morphisms for the class of inner-andoyne maps.
