The following is a list of potential topics for lectures by the seminar participants.
It is not exhaustive; you are welcome to propose your own topic! You are also welcome
to email us with suggested references for any given topic.

## Topics claimed by a participant:

- Weighted limits and colimits.
  - Claimed by James Macpherson, who will tell us about weighted joins.
  - Ref: [Max Kelly – Basic concepts of enriched category theory](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/10/tr10.pdf), Section 3.1; [Martina Rovelli – Weighted limits in an (∞,1)-category](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00805).
- (∞,n)-categories.
  - Claimed by Björn Gohla, who will tell us about Segal n-categories.
  - Ref: Julia Bergner and Charles Rezk - [Comparison of models for (∞,n)-categories, I](https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2013) and [Comparison of models for (∞,n)-categories, II](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4182), Carlos Simpson - Homotopy theory of higher categories ([draft version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4071)).
- The hypotheses: cobordism, tangle, homotopy, and/or stabilization.
  - Claimed by Rui Peixoto, who will tell us about the cobordism hypothesis.
  - Ref: [John Baez and James Dolan - Higher-dimensional Algebra and Topological Quantum Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/q-alg/9503002), [John Baez - The homotopy hypothesis](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/homotopy/homotopy.pdf).
   - Note: In the Baez-Dolan reference, the cobordism hypothesis is called "The Extended TQFT Hypothesis, Part I".
- Operads and ∞-operads.
  - Claimed by João Candeias.
  - Ref: [Jacob Lurie - Higher algebra](https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie/papers/HA.pdf), Chapter 2.
- Topological field theories or other functorial field theories.
  - Claimed by Nino Scalbi.
  - Ref: [Jacob Lurie - On the classification of topological field theories](https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie/papers/cobordism.pdf), among others.
